# ATTiny-Kids
ATTiny Code written so middle school kids can edit it to customize their circuitry projects.

This code is meant to be loaded onto ATTiny85 chips using a USB Programmer (we use [SparkFun's Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801) and the Arduino IDE. Getting the drivers to work has been somewhat challenging. What has worked for us with on Windows 10 with the Arduino IDE 1.8.5 is:
1. Follow the [Sparkfun Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tiny-avr-programmer-hookup-guide/) first.
2. Install [these drivers](https://learn.adafruit.com/usbtinyisp/drivers) from Adafruit.
3. Set the board to ATTiny, the processor to ATTiny85 and the programmer to USBTinyISP.
